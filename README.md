Description : TASK 1 (Interactive Quiz Application)

In this task, I worked on designing and developing an interactive quiz application that tests knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea behind building this project was not just to create a simple question-and-answer platform but to make it engaging, user-friendly, and practical so that anyone using it can learn and test their basics of web development.

The quiz is designed with 10 multiple-choice questions that cover fundamental concepts of web technologies. These include topics such as HTML structure and tags, CSS properties, selectors, and JavaScript syntax, variables, and functions. Each question has four options, and only one of them is correct. When a user selects an answer, the application automatically moves forward, and in case time runs out, the quiz also shifts to the next question. This ensures that the quiz feels dynamic and fast-paced, which keeps the user engaged.

From a technical perspective, I used HTML to structure the quiz layout, CSS for styling and making the interface visually appealing, and JavaScript for handling all the logic such as the timer, score calculation, navigation between questions, progress bar, and theme switching. The user starts by entering their name, which makes the quiz more personalized. Once the quiz is over, the final score is displayed along with a message that feels encouraging and motivating. Additionally, there is a restart button that allows users to retake the quiz and try to improve their score. This makes the project reusable and interactive.

One of the features I particularly liked implementing was the timer countdown. Every question has 30 seconds, and the timer is updated dynamically using JavaScript. This not only adds a sense of urgency but also makes the quiz closer to real-life exam scenarios where time management is crucial. The progress bar was another interesting addition. As the user moves through questions, the progress bar fills up, giving a clear indication of how much of the quiz is left. I also included a dark/light mode toggle, which makes the application more modern and accessible to users who prefer different themes.

In terms of usability, this project can be applied in several areas. For example, it can be used by educators and trainers who want to quickly test their students’ knowledge of web technologies. It can also be integrated into online learning platforms as a mini-assessment after each module. Furthermore, it can serve as a practice tool for students preparing for interviews or exams where web development basics are tested. Even companies conducting skill-based assessments can make use of such quizzes to screen candidates in the initial stages.

Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic updates using JavaScript. I learned how to properly structure code so that it remains clean and readable. For example, separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into different files made the project more organized and professional. I also gained more confidence in writing logic for features like navigation, progress updates, and user input handling.

Overall, this task helped me to combine design and logic in one project. It was not just about writing code but also about thinking from the perspective of a user — how they would interact with the quiz, what would make it fun, and what would keep them engaged. The end result is a small but complete application that reflects both creativity and technical skills, and it can be further expanded with more questions, categories, or even a scoring leaderboard in the future.
